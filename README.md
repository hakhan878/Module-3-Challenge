# Overview of Election Audit
    - The purpose of this election audit assignment is to increase our familiarity and proficiency in retrieving meaningful data from an external file i.e. csv.
    - We also practice writing results to an external text file.

# Election Audit Summary
    - The script used here can be used for any election, so long as the desired parameters are collected properly. 
    - For instance, you could collect and analyze voter demographics; if demographic information is collected in a csv file, we may extrapolate trends simply by adding another "for" loop which extracts the demographic information from each row.
    - Secondly, you could modify the script to compare individual candidates or counties by using loops to count and compare only specific counties found within the dataset.
